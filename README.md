Get all 10 Failing Rspec tests to pass by typing "rspec" into the command line

Test 1: There is a failing implementation of a new feature! A new intern was supposed to add an image uploader feature to our application, but it isn’t working! Your job is to go in and save the day by fixing the broken feature and enabling photos to finally be uploaded. 

Test 2: Marketing is waiting on our latest new feature to come out, the fancifier. Guaranteed to revolutionize photo uploading, the fancifier enables users to turn their titles into palindromes. They want you to be able to take a word like Panda and turn it into PandaadnaP, the same intern has already started it but abandoned the project. You need to go into lib/fancifier.rb and fix the broken features by filling in the methods. 

Test 3: Marketing has another feature they want, yesterday! Users need to be able to change the color of the photo titles and worst of all your senior dev says each color has to have its own method. Worse yet, he wants you to be able to handle thousands of colors, each with a unique method on the fancifier class. To make matters worse, marketing is going to be able to add and delete new colors through an html page and the methods need to be updated automatically. You have no idea why your senior developer wants to do it this way, but you better go along with what he says...

Test 4: In order to get better data analytics Marketing has decided to implement their own method to find the closest restaurant to any user. They are not satisfied with current technology and have given you the task of finishing up Dijkstra’s algorithm. A visiting scientist did the beginning work in lib/data_analytics.rb but you need to finish it with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
